"Fearless","Love Story",2,"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
"Fearless","Love Story",3,"I'm standing there"
"Fearless","Love Story",4,"On a balcony in summer air"

"Fearless","Love Story",7,"And say, ""Hello"""
"Fearless","Love Story",8,"Little did I know"
"Fearless","Love Story",9,"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
"Fearless","Love Story",10,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
"Fearless","Love Story",11,"And I was crying on the staircase"
"Fearless","Love Story",12,"Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"
"Fearless","Love Story",13,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"Fearless","Love Story",14,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
"Fearless","Love Story",15,"You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess"
"Fearless","Love Story",16,"It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes"""
"Fearless","Love Story",17,"So I sneak out to the garden to see you"
"Fearless","Love Story",18,"We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew"
"Fearless","Love Story",19,"So close your eyes"
"Fearless","Love Story",20,"Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh"
"Fearless","Love Story",21,"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
"Fearless","Love Story",22,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
"Fearless","Love Story",23,"But you were everything to me"
"Fearless","Love Story",24,"I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"

"Fearless","Love Story",34,"I got tired of waiting"
"Fearless","Love Story",35,"Wondering if you were ever coming around"
"Fearless","Love Story",36,"My faith in you was fading"
"Fearless","Love Story",37,"When I met you on the outskirts of town"
"Fearless","Love Story",38,"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone"
"Fearless","Love Story",39,"I keep waiting for you but you never come"
"Fearless","Love Story",40,"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"""
"Fearless","Love Story",41,"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said"
"Fearless","Love Story",42,"""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone"
"Fearless","Love Story",43,"I love you, and that's all I really know"
"Fearless","Love Story",44,"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress"

"Fearless","Hey Stephen",7,"I didn't say half the things I wanted to"
"Fearless","Hey Stephen",8,"Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window"

"Fearless","Hey Stephen",10,"Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing"
"Fearless","Hey Stephen",11,"I don't always have to be alone"
"Fearless","Hey Stephen",12,"'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel"

"Fearless","Hey Stephen",33,"And pull me near and shine, shine, shine"
"Fearless","Hey Stephen",34,"Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons"
"Fearless","Hey Stephen",35,"Why I should be the one you choose"

"Fearless","White Horse",11,"Now it's too late for you and your white horse"
"Fearless","White Horse",12,"To come around"
"Fearless","White Horse",13,"Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes"
"Fearless","White Horse",14,"And never really had a chance"
"Fearless","White Horse",15,"My mistake, I didn't know to be in love"
"Fearless","White Horse",16,"You had to fight to have the upper hand"

"Fearless","Tell Me Why",6,"I'm feeling like I don't know you"
"Fearless","Tell Me Why",7,"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down"
"Fearless","Tell Me Why",8,"And I need you like a heartbeat"
"Fearless","Tell Me Why",9,"But you know you got a mean streak"
"Fearless","Tell Me Why",10,"That makes me run for cover when you're around"
"Fearless","Tell Me Why",11,"And here's to you and your temper"

"Fearless","Tell Me Why",13,"And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me"

"Fearless","Tell Me Why",18,"I'm sick and tired of your reasons"

"Fearless","Tell Me Why",31,"So you're the only thing on my mind?"
"Fearless","Tell Me Why",32,"I'm sick and tired of your attitude"

"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",1,"All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",2,"I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",3,"And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",4,"And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",5,"You don't have to call anymore"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",6,"I won't pick up the phone"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",7,"This is the last straw"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",8,"Don't wanna hurt anymore"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",9,"And you can tell me that you're sorry"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",10,"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",11,"You're not sorry (No no no no)"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",12,"You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",13,"Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",14,"And you've got your share of secrets"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",15,"And I'm tired of being last to know, oh"

"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",22,"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",23,"You're not sorry (No no no no)"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",24,"You're not sorry (No no no no)"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",25,"You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",26,"You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",27,"So you don't have to call anymore"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",28,"I won't pick up the phone"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",29,"This is the last straw"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",30,"There's nothing left to beg for"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",31,"And you can tell me that you're sorry"
"Fearless","You're Not Sorry",32,"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"

"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",6,"And he says you look beautiful tonight"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",7,"And I feel perfectly fine"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",8,"But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",9,"And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",10,"You're so in love that you act insane"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",11,"And that's the way I loved you"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",12,"Breaking down and coming undone"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",13,"It's a roller coaster kind of rush"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",14,"And I never knew I could feel that much"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",15,"And that's the way I loved you"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",16,"He respects my space"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",17,"And never makes me wait"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",18,"And he calls exactly when he says he will"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",19,"He's close to my mother"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",20,"Talks business with my father"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",21,"He's charming and endearing"

"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",31,"He can't see the smile I'm faking"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",32,"And my heart's not breaking"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",33,"'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",34,"And you were wild and crazy"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",35,"Just so frustrating"
"Fearless","The Way I Loved You",36,"Intoxicating, complicated"

"Fearless","Forever & Always",16,"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",17,"Everything is wrong"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",18,"It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",19,"'Cause I was there when you said forever and always"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",20,"Was I out of line?"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",21,"Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",22,"Like a scared little boy?"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",23,"I looked into your eyes"
"Fearless","Forever & Always",24,"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure"

"Fearless","The Best Day",4,"Look now, the sky is gold"
"Fearless","The Best Day",5,"I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home"
"Fearless","The Best Day",6,"I don't know why all the trees change in the fall"
"Fearless","The Best Day",7,"But I know you're not scared of anything at all"
"Fearless","The Best Day",8,"Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away"
"Fearless","The Best Day",9,"But I know I had the best day with you today"
"Fearless","The Best Day",10,"I'm thirteen now"
"Fearless","The Best Day",11,"And don't know how my friends could be so mean"
"Fearless","The Best Day",12,"I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys"
"Fearless","The Best Day",13,"And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away"
"Fearless","The Best Day",14,"And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names"
"Fearless","The Best Day",15,"I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school"
"Fearless","The Best Day",16,"But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you"

"Fearless","The Best Day",20,"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out"
"Fearless","The Best Day",21,"He's better than I am"
"Fearless","The Best Day",22,"I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run"
"Fearless","The Best Day",23,"And I had the best days with you"
"Fearless","The Best Day",24,"There is a video I found from back when I was three"
"Fearless","The Best Day",25,"You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me"
"Fearless","The Best Day",26,"It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs"
"Fearless","The Best Day",27,"And Daddy's smart"
"Fearless","The Best Day",28,"And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world"
"Fearless","The Best Day",29,"And now I know why all the trees change in the fall"
"Fearless","The Best Day",30,"I know you were on my side even when I was wrong"
"Fearless","The Best Day",31,"And I love you for giving me your eyes"
"Fearless","The Best Day",32,"For staying back and watching me shine"
"Fearless","The Best Day",33,"And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say"

"Fearless","Change",13,"Oh, oh"
"Fearless","Change",14,"So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered"
"Fearless","Change",15,"It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair"
"Fearless","Change",16,"We're getting stronger now, find things they never found"
"Fearless","Change",17,"They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared"
"Fearless","Change",18,"You can walk away, say we don't need this"
"Fearless","Change",19,"But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this"
"Fearless","Change",20,"'Cause these things will change"

"Fearless","Change",31,"It was the night things changed"
"Fearless","Change",32,"Can you see it now?"
"Fearless","Change",33,"These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down"
"Fearless","Change",34,"It's a revolution, throw your hands up"
"Fearless","Change",35,"'Cause we never gave in"
"Fearless","Change",36,"And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah"
"Fearless","Change",37,"Hallelujah"

"Speak Now","Never Grow Up",17,"At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do"
"Speak Now","Never Grow Up",18,"And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots"
"Speak Now","Never Grow Up",19,"But don't make her drop you off around the block"

"Speak Now","Enchanted",2,"Forcing laughter, faking smiles"
"Speak Now","Enchanted",3,"Same old tired, lonely place"
"Speak Now","Enchanted",4,"Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy"

"Speak Now","Better Than Revenge",20,"She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it"
"Speak Now","Better Than Revenge",21,"I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling"
"Speak Now","Better Than Revenge",22,"And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things"
"Speak Now","Better Than Revenge",23,"But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know"
"Speak Now","Better Than Revenge",24,"Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go"
"Speak Now","Better Than Revenge",25,"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me"

"Speak Now","Long Live",18,"I passed the pictures around"
"Speak Now","Long Live",19,"Of all the years that we stood there"
"Speak Now","Long Live",20,"On the side-lines wishing for right now"
"Speak Now","Long Live",21,"We are the kings and the queens"
"Speak Now","Long Live",22,"You traded your baseball cap for a crown"
"Speak Now","Long Live",23,"When they gave us our trophies"
"Speak Now","Long Live",24,"And we held them up for our town"
"Speak Now","Long Live",25,"And the cynics were outraged"
"Speak Now","Long Live",26,"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""

"Speak Now","Long Live",46,"And force us into a goodbye"
"Speak Now","Long Live",47,"If you have children some day"
"Speak Now","Long Live",48,"When they point to the pictures"
"Speak Now","Long Live",49,"Please tell them my name"
"Speak Now","Long Live",50,"Tell them how the crowds went wild"
"Speak Now","Long Live",51,"Tell them how I hope they shine"
"Speak Now","Long Live",52,"Long live the walls we crashed through"

"Red","Treacherous",1,"Put your lips close to mine"
"Red","Treacherous",2,"As long as they don't touch"
"Red","Treacherous",3,"Out of focus, eye to eye"
"Red","Treacherous",4,"'Til the gravity's too much"
"Red","Treacherous",5,"And I'll do anything you say"
"Red","Treacherous",6,"If you say it with your hands"
"Red","Treacherous",7,"And I'd be smart to walk away"
"Red","Treacherous",8,"But you're quicksand"
"Red","Treacherous",9,"This slope is treacherous"

"Red","Treacherous",12,"And I-I-I like it"
"Red","Treacherous",13,"I can't decide if it's a choice"
"Red","Treacherous",14,"Getting swept away"
"Red","Treacherous",15,"I hear the sound of my own voice"
"Red","Treacherous",16,"Asking you to stay"
"Red","Treacherous",17,"And all we are is skin and bone"
"Red","Treacherous",18,"Trained to get along"
"Red","Treacherous",19,"Forever going with the flow"

"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",1,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",2,"I was in your sights, you got me alone"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",3,"You found me, you found me, you found me"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",4,"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",5,"And when I fell hard, you took a step back"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",6,"Without me, without me, without me"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",7,"And he's long gone when he's next to me"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",8,"And I realize the blame is on me"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",9,"'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",10,"So shame on me now"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",11,"Flew me to places I'd never been"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",12,"'Til you put me down, oh"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",13,"I knew you were trouble when you walked in"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",14,"So shame on me now"

"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",22,"Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",23,"You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",24,"And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",25,"A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",26,"And now I see, now I see, now I see"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",27,"He was long gone when he met me"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",28,"And I realize the joke is on me, hey"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",29,"I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",30,"So shame on me now"

"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",43,"That you never loved me"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",44,"Or her, or anyone, or anything"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",45,"Yeah"
"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",46,"I knew you were trouble when you walked in"

"Red","I Knew You Were Trouble",61,"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
"Red","All Too Well",1,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold"
"Red","All Too Well",2,"But something 'bout it felt like home somehow"
"Red","All Too Well",3,"And I left my scarf there at your sister's house"
"Red","All Too Well",4,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now"
"Red","All Too Well",5,"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze"
"Red","All Too Well",6,"We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate"
"Red","All Too Well",7,"Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place"
"Red","All Too Well",8,"And I can picture it after all these days"
"Red","All Too Well",9,"And I know it's long gone and"
"Red","All Too Well",10,"That magic's not here no more"
"Red","All Too Well",11,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all"
"Red","All Too Well",12,"Oh, oh, oh"
"Red","All Too Well",13,"'Cause there we are again on that little town street"
"Red","All Too Well",14,"You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me"
"Red","All Too Well",15,"Wind in my hair, I was there"
"Red","All Too Well",16,"I remember it all too well"
"Red","All Too Well",17,"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red"
"Red","All Too Well",18,"You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed"
"Red","All Too Well",19,"And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team"
"Red","All Too Well",20,"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me"
"Red","All Too Well",21,"And I know it's long gone and"
"Red","All Too Well",22,"There was nothing else I could do"
"Red","All Too Well",23,"And I forget about you long enough"
"Red","All Too Well",24,"To forget why I needed to"
"Red","All Too Well",25,"'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night"
"Red","All Too Well",26,"We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light"
"Red","All Too Well",27,"Down the stairs, I was there"
"Red","All Too Well",28,"I remember it all too well, yeah"
"Red","All Too Well",29,"Maybe we got lost in translation"
"Red","All Too Well",30,"Maybe I asked for too much"
"Red","All Too Well",31,"But maybe this thing was a masterpiece"
"Red","All Too Well",32,"'Til you tore it all up"
"Red","All Too Well",33,"Running scared, I was there"
"Red","All Too Well",34,"I remember it all too well"
"Red","All Too Well",35,"And you call me up again"
"Red","All Too Well",36,"Just to break me like a promise"
"Red","All Too Well",37,"So casually cruel in the name of being honest"
"Red","All Too Well",38,"I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here"
"Red","All Too Well",39,"'Cause I remember it all, all, all"
"Red","All Too Well",40,"Too well"
"Red","All Too Well",41,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it"
"Red","All Too Well",42,"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it"
"Red","All Too Well",43,"After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own"
"Red","All Too Well",44,"Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone"
"Red","All Too Well",45,"But you keep my old scarf from that very first week"
"Red","All Too Well",46,"'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me"
"Red","All Too Well",47,"You can't get rid of it"
"Red","All Too Well",48,"'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah"
"Red","All Too Well",49,"'Cause there we are again when I loved you so"
"Red","All Too Well",50,"Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known"
"Red","All Too Well",51,"It was rare, I was there"
"Red","All Too Well",52,"I remember it all too well"
"Red","All Too Well",53,"Wind in my hair, you were there"
"Red","All Too Well",54,"You remember it all"
"Red","All Too Well",55,"Down the stairs, you were there"
"Red","All Too Well",56,"You remember it all"
"Red","All Too Well",57,"It was rare, I was there"
"Red","All Too Well",58,"I remember it all too well"
"Red","22",1,"It feels like a perfect night"
"Red","22",2,"To dress up like hipsters"
"Red","22",3,"And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh"
"Red","22",4,"It feels like a perfect night"
"Red","22",5,"For breakfast at midnight"
"Red","22",6,"To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh"
"Red","22",7,"Yeah"
"Red","22",8,"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time"
"Red","22",9,"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
"Red","22",10,"Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines"
"Red","22",11,"It's time, oh-oh"
"Red","22",12,"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
"Red","22",13,"Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you"
"Red","22",14,"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
"Red","22",15,"Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're"
"Red","22",16,"22, 22"
"Red","22",17,"It seems like one of those nights"
"Red","22",18,"This place is too crowded"
"Red","22",19,"Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh"
"Red","22",20,"(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)"
"Red","22",21,"It seems like one of those nights"
"Red","22",22,"We ditch the whole scene"
"Red","22",23,"And end up dreaming"
"Red","22",24,"Instead of sleeping"
"Red","22",25,"Yeah"
"Red","22",26,"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way"
"Red","22",27,"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
"Red","22",28,"Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks"
"Red","22",29,"It's time, oh-oh"
"Red","22",30,"(Hey!)"
"Red","22",31,"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
"Red","22",32,"Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you"
"Red","22",33,"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
"Red","22",34,"Everything will be alright if (Alright)"
"Red","22",35,"We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
"Red","22",36,"22 (I don't know about you)"
"Red","22",37,"22, 22"
"Red","22",38,"It feels like one of those nights"
"Red","22",39,"We ditch the whole scene"
"Red","22",40,"It feels like one of those nights"
"Red","22",41,"We won't be sleeping"
"Red","22",42,"It feels like one of those nights"
"Red","22",43,"You look like bad news"
"Red","22",44,"I gotta have you"
"Red","22",45,"I gotta have you"
"Red","22",46,"Ooh, ooh, yeah"
"Red","22",47,"(Hey!)"
"Red","22",48,"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
"Red","22",49,"Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you"
"Red","22",50,"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
"Red","22",51,"Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're"
"Red","22",52,"22 (Whoa, oh)"
"Red","22",53,"22 (Dancing like)"
"Red","22",54,"22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
"Red","22",55,"It feels like one of those nights"
"Red","22",56,"We ditch the whole scene"
"Red","22",57,"It feels like one of those nights"
"Red","22",58,"We won't be sleeping"
"Red","22",59,"It feels like one of those nights"
"Red","22",60,"You look like bad news"
"Red","22",61,"I gotta have you"
"Red","22",62,"I gotta have you"
"Red","I Almost Do",1,"I bet this time of night, you're still up"
"Red","I Almost Do",2,"I bet you're tired from a long hard week"
"Red","I Almost Do",3,"I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window"
"Red","I Almost Do",4,"Looking out at the city, and I bet"
"Red","I Almost Do",5,"Sometimes you wonder 'bout me"
"Red","I Almost Do",6,"And I just wanna tell you"
"Red","I Almost Do",7,"It takes everything in me not to call you"
"Red","I Almost Do",8,"And I wish I could run to you"
"Red","I Almost Do",9,"And I hope you know that"
"Red","I Almost Do",10,"Every time I don't, I almost do, I almost do"
"Red","I Almost Do",11,"I bet you think I either moved on or hate you"
"Red","I Almost Do",12,"'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply"
"Red","I Almost Do",13,"I bet it never, ever occurred to you"
"Red","I Almost Do",14,"That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye"
"Red","I Almost Do",15,"And I just wanna tell you"
"Red","I Almost Do",16,"It takes everything in me not to call you"

"Red","I Almost Do",19,"Every time I don't, I almost do, I almost do"
"Red","I Almost Do",20,"Oh, we made quite a mess, babe"
"Red","I Almost Do",21,"It's probably better off this way"
"Red","I Almost Do",22,"And I confess, babe"
"Red","I Almost Do",23,"In my dreams, you're touching my face"
"Red","I Almost Do",24,"And asking me if I want to try again with you"
"Red","I Almost Do",25,"And I almost do"
"Red","I Almost Do",26,"And I just wanna tell you"

"Red","I Almost Do",35,"Sometimes you wonder 'bout me"
"Red","We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",1,"I remember when we broke up the first time"
"Red","We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",2,"Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like"
"Red","We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",3,"We hadn't seen each other in a month"
"Red","We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",4,"When you said you needed space (What?)"
"Red","We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",5,"Then you come around again and say"

"Red","Stay Stay Stay",4,"But you stayed"
"Red","Stay Stay Stay",5,"This morning, I said we should talk about it"
